# Inventory-Management-System-ETG-

In this project i have created a IMS where the user can see the description of the products, buy the products etc

Functionalities of this project are:

1. If the user types like 'Snacks' or 'Chocolates' it will show the entire description of the particular type for eg:product id, name, quantity, price and so on
2. If the user type product id it will show the product name and asks us how many quantity we want of that type
3. (Special functionality)At the start the user will be to enter the budget, if the budget is higher than the total price it will not allow us to shop i.e it exits
4. At last it will be us the bill receipt with a clean formatted table

All the informations are stored and fetched from json file
